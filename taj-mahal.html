			The <b>Taj-mahal</b>'Crown of the Palace',  is an Islamic ivory-white marble mausoleum
            on the right bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned 
            in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his
            favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb
            is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a
            guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.
            Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other 
            phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been
             completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million,
            which in 2020 would be approximately ₹70 billion (about US $1 billion). The construction
            project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by 
            the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri. Various types of symbolism have
             been employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and divinity.The Taj Mahal was designated
            as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one
            of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by many
            as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The
            Taj Mahal attracts more than 6 million visitors a year and in 2007, it was declared
             a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World  initiative.

        <h2>Exterior Decoration</h2>
		
		
			
            <p> The monument was erected by shah Jahan.The exterior decorations of the Taj Mahal
            are among the finest in Mughal architecture. As the surface area changes, the 
            decorations are refined proportionally. The decorative elements were created by
            applying paint, stucco, stone inlays or carvings. In line with the Islamic 
            prohibition against the use of anthropomorphic forms, the decorative elements 
            can be grouped into either calligraphy, abstract forms or vegetative motifs. 
            Throughout the complex are passages from the Qur'an that comprise some of the
            decorative elements. Recent scholarship suggests that Amanat Khan chose the passages.
            The calligraphy on the Great Gate reads "O Soul, thou art at rest. Return to the Lord
             at peace with Him, and He at peace with you."[28] The calligraphy was created in 1609
            by a calligrapher named Abdul Haq. Shah Jahan conferred the title of "Amanat Khan"
            upon him as a reward for his "dazzling virtuosity".[29] Near the lines from
            the Qur'an at the base of the interior dome is the inscription, "Written by
            the insignificant being, Amanat Khan Shirazi."[30] Much of the calligraphy 
             is composed of florid thuluth script made of jasper or black marble[29] inlaid
            in white marble panels. Higher panels are written in slightly larger script to 
            reduce the skewing effect when viewed from below. The calligraphy found on the
             marble cenotaphs in the tomb is particularly detailed and delicate.On the lower
             walls of the tomb are white marble dados sculpted with realistic bas relief depiction
            of flowers and vines. The marble has been polished to emphasise the exquisite detailing
            of the carvings. The dado frames and archway spandrels have been decorated with pietra
            dura inlays of highly stylised, almost geometric vines, flowers and fruits. The inlay
             stones are of yellow marble, jasper and jade, polished and levelled to the surface of the walls

		<h2>Interior Decoration</h2>

		<p>
			The interior chamber of the Taj Mahal reaches far beyond traditional decorative elements
            . The inlay work is not pietra dura, but a lapidary of precious and semiprecious gemstones.
            The inner chamber is an octagon with the design allowing for entry from each face, although
             only the door facing the garden to the south is used. The interior walls are about 25 metres
            (82 ft) high and are topped by a "false" interior dome decorated with a sun motif. Eight 
            pishtaq arches define the space at ground level and, as with the exterior, each lower pishtaq
            is crowned by a second pishtaq about midway up the wall.[33] The four central upper arches
            form balconies or viewing areas, and each balcony's exterior window has an intricate screen
            or jali cut from marble. In addition to the light from the balcony screens, light enters
            through roof openings covered by chattris at the corners. The octagonal marble screen or
            jali bordering the cenotaphs is made from eight marble panels carved through with 
            intricate pierce work. The remaining surfaces are inlaid in delicate detail with semi-precious
            stones forming twining vines, fruits and flowers. Each chamber wall is highly decorated with 
            dado bas-relief, intricate lapidary inlay and refined calligraphy panels which reflect, in little detail,
             the design elements seen throughout the exterior of the complex.

			The main gateway (darwaza) is a monumental structure built primarily of marble, and reminiscent of the
             Mughal architecture of earlier emperors. Its archways mirror the shape of the tomb's archways, and its 
             pishtaq arches incorporate the calligraphy that decorates the tomb. It utilises bas-relief and pietra 
             dura inlaid decorations with floral motifs. The vaulted ceilings and walls have elaborate geometric 
             designs like those found in the other sandstone buildings in the complex.At the far end of the complex
              are two grand red sandstone buildings that mirror each other, and face the sides of the tomb. The backs
             of the buildings parallel the western and eastern walls. The western building is a mosque and the other
             is the jawab (answer), thought to have been constructed for architectural balance although it may have 
             been used as a guesthouse. Distinctions between the two buildings include the jawab's lack of a mihrab 
            (a niche in a mosque's wall facing Mecca), and its floors of geometric design whereas the floor of the
            mosque is laid with outlines of 569 prayer rugs in black marble. The mosque's basic design of a long
            hall surmounted by three domes is similar to others built by Shah Jahan, particularly the Masjid-i Jahān-Numā, 
            Masjid, Delhi.
